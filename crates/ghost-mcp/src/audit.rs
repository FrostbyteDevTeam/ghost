//! Built-in interference audit: proof, per session, that Ghost never took the
//! human's foreground.
//!
//! `ghost verify` checks the claim once. This checks it continuously: a sampler
//! reads the foreground window and `GetLastInputInfo` every 100 ms; a foreground
//! change that happens with no real hardware input in the last 1.5 s cannot have
//! been the human, so it is recorded as a SYNTHETIC incident together with the
//! tool calls in flight at that moment. `ghost_stats` and `ghost_session_state`
//! report the tally. Ghost does not grade itself: the sampler is independent of
//! every dispatch path and cannot be told to look away.
//!
//! The sampler also ACTS. A per-call foreground guard (see
//! `GhostSession::foreground_guard_end_within`) can only watch while the call
//! runs, and a Chromium window activates itself again after the verb has
//! answered - measured 2026-09-06 on a real desktop: the browser took the
//! human's foreground between calls and held it for 30 s while their keystrokes
//! went into the web page. So the sampler is also a sentinel: while the policy
//! is `background`, a foreground change to a window Ghost is driving that the
//! human did not make is handed straight back. It stands down the moment the
//! human takes that window themselves, and after a few rounds of losing.
//!
//! Windows only (foreground and last-input are Win32 concepts); `GHOST_AUDIT=off`
//! disables the sampler, and with it the sentinel.
